# COVID Tracker
A simple `Vue` application that shows the amount of COVID-19 cases and deaths for the day.\
This was made so I could get a good understanding of how `Vue` worked, and if it was something that I would enjoy.

## How to Run
For now while in development, you will have to clone/download the files and run `npm run dev` or if you are using yarn `yarn dev`. Once deployed in production, I will leave a link for the production url.
