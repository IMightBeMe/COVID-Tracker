# COVID Tracker
A simple `Vue` application that shows the amount of COVID-19 cases and deaths for the day.\
This was made so I could get a good understanding of how `Vue` worked, and if it was something that I would enjoy.

## How to Run
Navigate to the link posted on the repo.

## How it Works
Using a covid tracking api from `disease.sh`, I got the daily deaths and cases, as well as the total deaths and cases caused by COVID-19.
